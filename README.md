**_OBJECTIVE_**

Design an end-to-end business intelligence solution using the [Adventure Works Cycles](https://github.com/kuta-ndze/KPIDashboarding/blob/main/AdventureWorks.pdf) that should be able to do the followings:

- Track **KPIs** (_Sales, Revenue, Profit, Returns_), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and forecasts, and identify high-value customers.
- Build a relational data model
- Create new Calculated Columns and DAX measures
- Design an interactive report to analyze and visualize the data
- Achieving this i have used the raw CSV files containing information about transactions, returns, products, customers and territories attached in this sGithub repo.

**_METHODOLOGY_**

Three main sections:

**Section 1: Executive Summary**

Allows you to break down the data , explore information by categories, subcategories, explore core business KPIs, revenue, order volume and returns for the current month, snapshots of most ordered product and top revenue product and the ability to filter down the entire page by specific regions, drill through functionality to dive deeper into specific product performance.

Will be able to navigate directly to product details while in executive summary page with a link. Here you should be able to see specific product performance, provide insights like pasing against targets, profit trending over time and forecast into the future and even scenario test to see the impact of pricing adjustments on actual bottom line company profits.
